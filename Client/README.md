Appointment Booking Web App 

This is a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) web application designed to simplify appointment booking for hospitals and salons.

Features->

📅 Book Appointments – Users can select department, doctor, date, and time, with options for emergency or regular slots.

🧾 Lab Test Reports – Users can view and download their reports directly from their profile.

⏳ Live Queue Tracking – Displays the real-time position in the queue and notifies the user when their turn is near.

🔐 OTP Verification – Patients provide an OTP to the cabin assistant before entering; queues update automatically when a new patient enters.

📍 Nearby Services – Find nearby hospitals, pathology labs, and ambulance contacts based on current location.

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family Profiles – One account can manage appointments for all family members, each with their own profile, prescriptions, doctor history, and lab reports.

🏥💇 Multi-Use Support – Works for both hospital consultations and salon bookings.

Project Status->

Currently working on the backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB) for user management, appointments, queue handling, OTP system, and lab test reports.

Frontend (React.js) implementation will be developed in the next phase.
